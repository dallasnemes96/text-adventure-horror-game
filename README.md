# text-adventure-horror-game
Hi everyone. I have been learning how to code with Python the past few months and decided to create my first text-adventure horror game. I have been working on it for days but cannot seem to make all of the options to make it run properly. It does not seem to print/activate most of the options/pathways. Please help.
